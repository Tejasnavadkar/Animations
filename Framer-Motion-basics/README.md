Motion vs Framer-Motion

Framer Motion has been rebranded as Motion, with the `motion` package being the new official name for what was previously known as Framer Motion The author, Matt Perry, clarified that this is not a split but a rebranding due to legal requirements after leaving Framer, and both `framer-motion` and `motion` packages deliver the exact same code Developers can continue using the `framer-motion` package, as it remains fully functional and receives the same updates

The `motion` package (formerly Framer Motion) is a declarative, React-focused animation library that simplifies complex animations with features like gesture support, layout animations, and intuitive props such as `animate`, `initial`, and `whileHover` It abstracts away much of the complexity involved in managing animation lifecycles and DOM manipulation, making it ideal for React developers seeking a smooth developer experience

While some newer CSS features may reduce the need for libraries in simple cases like animating to `height: auto`, the Framer Motion (now Motion) API is still preferred by many for its simplicity and maintainability, especially when dealing with more complex interactions For React projects requiring sophisticated animations, Motion (formerly Framer Motion) is often recommended over lower-level alternatives due to its high-level, declarative syntax

The confusion between `motion` and `framer-motion` stems from the rebranding, but they refer to the same library at their core, with `motion` being the current direction of development







For your React project, you should install the new official package:


`npm install motion`


### Why `motion` instead of `framer-motion`?

- The library formerly known as **Framer Motion** has been rebranded to **Motion**.
- The creator, Matt Perry, has moved development to the [`motion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/motion) package after leaving Framer due to legal naming restrictions.
- Both `motion` and `framer-motion` currently contain the **same code**, but new development and updates are focused on `motion`.
- `framer-motion` is still maintained for stability, but **`motion` is the future**.

> ‚úÖ Recommendation: Use `motion` for new projects.

### Getting Started as a Beginner

Even though the package name changed, **the API is identical**. So if you're learning, you can use either:

#### ‚úÖ Official Documentation (Recommended)
- **New official docs**: [https://motion.dev](https://motion.dev)  
  This is the up-to-date, interactive documentation for the `motion` package. It includes live examples, API references, and guides ‚Äî perfect for beginners.

#### üìö Legacy but Still Useful
- **Framer Motion docs**: [https://www.framer.com/motion](https://www.framer.com/motion)  
  These are still accurate for API usage and contain great examples. However, they may not reflect the latest updates now that development has moved.

> üîÅ Tip: The syntax and usage (`<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />`) are **exactly the same** in both packages.

### Quick Example (with `motion`)

```jsx
import { motion } from "motion";

function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
    >
      Hello, animated world!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```
